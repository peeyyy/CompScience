# Linear Regression (House Price Predictor) - **Laboratory Exercise 01**

A simple **Linear Regression** tool using **NumPy, Matplotlib, and Tkinter**.  
It predicts house prices based on size and computes:

-  **Slope (m)**
-  **Intercept (b)**
-  **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
-  **Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)**
-  **Regression Line Plot**
-  **Residual Plot**

# Naive Bayes Classifier (Car Status Predictor) - **Laboratory Exercise 02**
This program uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a car is "Old" or "New" based on its features: color, brand, and gasoline type. Users input the car's details, and the program validates the input before making a prediction. It allows for continuous predictions until the user decides to exit.
